About Anyone AI

At Anyone AI, we invest in people from Latin America, preparing them for the jobs of the future, and thus solve the existing talent shortage in the field of AI.

We have the support of global venture capital funds since day 1 ❤️ such as GFC -Global Founders Capital- (which invested in companies like Facebook, LinkedIn, Slack, Canva, Trivago, etc), Canvas Ventures (early stage investors in Coursera ) and Latitud Fund (the largest community of angel investors in Latin America with investments in QuintoAndar, La Haus, Clara, Platzi, OnTop, Pomelo, etc), among other investors.

Anyone AI is founded by AI/ML experts and 'second-time' entrepreneurs, members of the founding team of Deep Vision AI (acquired in 2020), where we work with Fortune 500 companies such as Nvidia, Intel, AWS, Dell, Cadence, Cox Automotive, FLIR, Mercado Libre, etc, completing multiple projects in AI, and bringing the best talent from LatAm closer to our clients.
